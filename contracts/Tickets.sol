USE CASE / USER STORIES

The event organizer creates a new event:
1. The user enters an events creation page under the login / password issued to him and fills out a form with the necessary data for the event -
name, description, location, number of available tickets, cost of tickets in   ETH, start date and end date.
2. After clicking the confirmation button, a new event is created in the blockchain, while before the start date
or before the sale of all tickets, ticket sales are available on the ticket purchase page (then the buy button is inactive),
after the end date the event is not displayed in the list of available
3. The user can cancel the event by clicking the Cancel button. After click  the button, the event disappears from the available ones.
The organizer makes refunds  to customers manually without using the application.

On the second page of the application, a regular visitor can buy a ticket to the event
1. The page displays a list of events, end date that greater than a current date. Each event displays an information -
name, description, location, ticket price tickets in ETH, start date and end date.
2. Each event has a window for entering an  ether wallet address and a ticket purchase button for buy it, which is active if there are free tickets
4. At the bottom of the event block there is a ticket control block - a ticket ID entry window with information near
about the ticket status ("Pending", "Payment was successful‚Äù), also a block has a window for entering an ether wallet address
and " Transfer ticket "button, after clicking on this button the owner of the ticket will changes on entered address
